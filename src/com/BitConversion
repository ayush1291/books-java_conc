1. Convert the number into binary representation
2. Only copy the rightmost 8 bits (LSB) and discard the rest.
3. From the result of step#2, if the leftmost bit is 0, then use a calculator to convert the number to decimal. 
This is your answer.
4. Else (if the leftmost bit is 1) your answer is negative. Leave all rightmost zeros and the first non-zero bit unchanged. 
And reversed the rest, that is, replace 1's by 0's and 0's by 1's. Then use a calculator to convert to decimal and append 
a negative sign to indicate the value is negative.

eg. 132 (base 10)
10000100 (base 2)
 int (00000000_00000000_00000000_10000100)  >> byte (10000100) :Java chops-off the left-most 24 bits
 If the left-most bit is 1 (as we have here), it means that the number is negative and more work needs to be done
01111100 >>>>>> 124
ad -ve sign : -124
