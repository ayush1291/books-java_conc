1. Throwable (superclass of all errors and exceptions)
public class Throwable
extends Object
implements Serializable

throw : only Throwable (or subclass) objects
catch : only Throwable (or subclass) objects
****Throwable and any subclass of Throwable that is not also a subclass of either RuntimeException or 
Error are regarded as checked exceptions.

2. Hierarchy
Throwable
	- Error (
	- Exception
		- RuntimeException
		-

3. Unchecked exceptions
they represent exceptions that a program shouldn't generally expect to occur, but could potentially recover from. They represent what are likely to be programming errors rather than errors due to invalid user input or a badly configured environment.

unchecked exceptions can be thrown "at any time";
methods don't explicitly have to declare that they can throw an unchecked exception;
callers don't have to handle them explicitly.

4. Checked exception
they generally represent errors that a program will expect to occur in the normal course of duty

5. Error
Error subclasses represent "serious" errors that a program generally shouldn't expect to catch and recover from. These include conditions such as an expected class file being missing, or an OutOfMemoryError.
